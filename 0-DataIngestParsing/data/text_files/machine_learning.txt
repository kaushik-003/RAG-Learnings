 Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data.
    It involves algorithms that improve their performance as they are exposed to more data over time.
    Common machine learning tasks include classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation.
    Machine learning is widely used in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
    Types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
